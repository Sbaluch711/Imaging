# Imaging

Imaging files are part of a project done in a course on working with the GPU. This project specifically works to add different image
filters using opencv

Next Steps:
try -1 0 1 as a kernel
    -2 0 2 
    -1 0 1 
generalize the cpu code to handle larger kernels
time with new kernel sizes
